The directory structure of this project is (partially) given by the
following diagram:

.
|-- doc
|   `-- Makefile
|-- Makefile
`-- src
    `-- Makefile

The directory 'src' contains the program source files. The Makefile in
this directory builds or cleans the program(s).

The directory 'doc' contains the Doxygen configuration. The Makefile
in this directory builds or cleans the documentation.

For convenience, there is a third Makefile in the base directory. This
Makefile builds or cleans everything by delegating the work to the
other Makefiles.

To build everything, say 'make' in the base directory.

To clean everything, say 'make clean' in the base directory.

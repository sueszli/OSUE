*@brief Implementation of the mycompress module.

*The mycompress module that consists of mycompress() function is defined.

/**
 * Main program function that fulfills the run-length compression.
 * @brief This function takes a character array and as it reads it index-by-index, the run-length coded compressed form of it gets written to the character array 'out'.
 * @details After initialization of 'out', a for-loop reads 'in' character by character and 'rep'Â´counts the number of repeatative characters, which is set back to 1 when 
 * a new character is read. Loop starts with 'out' that already has the first character from 'in' and either counts the 'rep' or insterts it in 'out' by using 'sprintf()'. 
 * After such an insertion, next index in 'out' gets the adjacent different character in 'in'. There are 2 if-cases that represent 2 possible states while reading the last 
 * character of 'in'. During either of them, loop is terminated by inserting '/0' at the end of 'out'.
 * @param in Constant character array. 'ind' indicates the next index in 'out' to receive a character from 'in'.
 * @param out Character array whose allocated memory is larger than twice the size of parameter 'in'

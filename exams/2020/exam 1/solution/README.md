## Instructions

The demo test environment is installed in the lab and is activated with the following
command (which has to be entered in every ssh terminal that we open):

```bash
source /opt/osue/demo-exam-1-2021W/setenv # see: /opt/osue/demo-exam-1-2021W
```

Then we have access to the following commands:


- `fetch`: fetch source code into `~/osue-demo-demotest-1`
- `deliver`: run unit tests


The content of this demo exam is the same as that of the previous year. The OSUE team also does not provide a second demo exam to practice with.

# Why are there 2 versions?

This exercise requires you to parse positive integers with multiple digits as node names.

This is unfortunate because if we had single character names for the nodes, then we could have made use of many functions from the standard library such as `strfry()` and `index()` which would make everything a lot simpler.

This is why I also created the (invalid) char version as a solution for this exercise.

# Why are there 2 versions?

This exercise requires you to parse positive integers with more than one digit as the node names.

This is unfortunate because if we had single character names, then we could have made use of lots of functions from the standard library like `strfry()` and `index()` that do exactly what we need for this algorithm.

I wrote this (invalid) version of my solution just to find out how much simpler everything would get.

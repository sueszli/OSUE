\section*{Assignment -- Integer Multiplication}
Implement an algorithm for the efficient multiplication of large integers.
\begin{verbatim}
    SYNOPSIS
        intmul
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Instructions}
The program takes two hexadecimal integers $A$ and $B$ with an equal number of digits as input, multiplies them and prints the result.
The input is read from \texttt{stdin} and consists of two lines:
the first line is the integer $A$ and the second line is the integer $B$.

Your program must accept any number of digits.
Terminate the program with exit status \verb|EXIT_FAILURE|
if an invalid input is encountered
or if the two integers do not have equal length.

The multiplication of the input values is calculated recursively,
i.e. by the program calling itself:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $A$ and $B$ both consist of only 1 hexadecimal digit, then multiply them,
write the result to \texttt{stdout} and exit with status \verb|EXIT_SUCCESS|.
\item Otherwise $A$ and $B$ both consist of $n>1$ digits. Split them both into two parts each,
with each part consisting of $n/2$ digits:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
\[
A:\quad\quad\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline \quad A_h \quad & \quad A_l \quad \\\hline\end{array}\quad\quad A=A_h\cdot 16^{n/2}+A_l
\]
\[
B:\quad\quad\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline \quad B_h \quad & \quad B_l \quad \\\hline\end{array}\quad\quad B=B_h\cdot 16^{n/2}+B_l
\]
Terminate the program with exit status \verb|EXIT_FAILURE|
if the number of digits is not even.

\item Using \osuefunc{fork(2)} and \osuefunc{execlp(3)},
recursively execute this program in four child processes,
one for each of the multiplications $A_h\cdot B_h$, $A_h\cdot B_l$, $A_l\cdot B_h$ and  $A_l\cdot B_l$.
Use two unnamed pipes per child
to redirect \osueglvar{stdin} and \osueglvar{stdout}
(see \osuefunc{pipe(2)} and \osuefunc{dup2(3)}).
Write the two values to be multiplied to \osueglvar{stdin} of each child.
Read the respective result from each child's \osueglvar{stdout}.
The four child processes must run simultaneously!

\item Use \osuefunc{wait(2)} or \osuefunc{waitpid(2)}
to read the exit status of the children.
Terminate the program with exit status \verb|EXIT_FAILURE|
if the exit status of any of the two child processes is not \verb|EXIT_SUCCESS|.

\item The result of the multiplication $A\cdot B$ can now be calculated as follows:
\[
A\cdot B=A_h\cdot B_h\cdot 16^n + A_h\cdot B_l\cdot 16^{n/2} + A_l\cdot B_h\cdot 16^{n/2} + A_l\cdot B_l
\]
Find a clever way to write the result of this operation to \texttt{stdout},
even if the numbers are too large for the C data types.
Remember that your program must deal with integers of any size!
Leading zeros should also be printed,
such that the result has twice as many digits as the input values.
Terminate the program with exit status \verb|EXIT_SUCCESS|.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Hints}

\begin{itemize}
\item Think of a way to add the four intermediate results together
one digit at a time while keeping track of the carry.
\item In order to avoid endless recursion\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork\_bomb}},
fork only if the input number is greater than 1.
\item To output error messages and debug messages, always use
\osueglvar{stderr} because \osueglvar{stdout} is redirected in most cases.
\item Due to the rejection of sequences of odd length by each (child-)process,
the algorithm has the property of only correctly processing sequences
where the length is a power of 2.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
$ cat 3.txt

$ ./intmul < 3.txt

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
$ cat 4.txt

$ ./intmul < 4.txt

\end{verbatim}
\end{multicols}

Small deviations of the resulting values,
which are a consequence of the limited precision of floating point numbers,
are not relevant and not considered to be an error.

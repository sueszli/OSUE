#include "common.h"

// Static variables for things you might want to access from several functions:
static const char *port = DEFAULT_PORT; // the port to bind to

// Static variables for resources that should be freed before exiting:
static struct addrinfo *ai = NULL;      // stores address information
static int sockfd = -1;                 // socket file descriptor
static int connfd = -1;                 // connection file descriptor

/* TODO
 * You might want to add further static variables here, for instance to save
 * the program name (argv[0]) since you should include it in all messages.
 *
 * You should also have some kind of a list which saves information about your
 * ships. For this purpose you might want to define a struct. Bear in mind that
 * your server must keep record about which ships have been hit (and also where
 * they have been hit) in order to know when a ship was sunk.
 *
 * You might also find it convenient to add a few functions, for instance:
 *  - a function which cleans up all resources and exits the program
 *  - a function which parses the arguments from the command line
 *  - a function which adds a new ship to your list of ships
 *  - a function which checks whether a client's shot hit any of your ships

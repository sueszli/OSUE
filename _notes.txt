Client requests file from server:

| GET <path> HTTP/1.1                        
| Host: www.name.com                         
| <...>                                      <--- arbitrary number of header fields
|                                            <--- no request body

Server transfers file to client:

| HTTP/1.1 200 OK
| Date: <date>
| Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
| Content-Length: <length>
| Last-Modified: <date>
| Connection: close
|

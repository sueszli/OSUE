# Wha are there 2 versions?

This exercise requires you to parse positive integers with more than one digit as the node names.

This is unfortunate because if we only would have used single characters, then we could have used lots of functions from the standard library like `strfry()` and `index()` that do exactly what we need.

I wrote this (invalid) version of my solution just to find out how much simpler everything would get.

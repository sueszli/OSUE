Exercise 1B:
  - Supervisor does not receive any data, because I'm sending pointers to the strings and not the actual chars.
    The pointers are not the same after being transferred via the shared memory.
    See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40200227/store-an-string-on-a-shared-memory-c

    This could be fixed by turning the node data types from string to single chars.
    This would require me to rewrite every single data structure and function I've written so far and I don't have
      the time for that.

Feedback: Iâ€™ve got a memory leak. There is a way to resolve my problem: virtual mapping pointers in shared memory.
